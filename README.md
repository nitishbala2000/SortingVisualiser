##Sorting visualiser

A react SPA to help students new to computer science learn about and visualise sorting algorithms. The project was inspired by [https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer) - I decided to practice my frontend skills to create a projet with the same idea but slightly better UI and with help information
